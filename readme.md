#LogViewer
I made this tool to view MS41 logs because I'm too cheap to buy MegaLogViewer and RomRaiderLogViewer kinda stinks.

You can open any CSV file with this, but the program is expecting an equal number of rows for every column, and the first row should have the names of the columns.

If you have any issues or feature requests feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
